/*
Problem Statement:
Given an integer array and a window of size w, find the current maximum value 
in the window as it slides through the entire array.
Note: If the window size is greater than the array size, we will consider 
the entire array as a single window.

Sample input:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
window_size = 3

Expected output:
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
